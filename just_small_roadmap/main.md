Great! Learning Linux system calls (syscalls) using C is a powerful way to deepen your understanding of how operating systems work. Below is a **learning roadmap** tailored for system calls in **Linux with C** — structured in progressive steps, with key topics, example syscalls, and practice ideas.

---

## 🧭 **Linux Syscalls Learning Roadmap (with C)**

---

### **🔰 Step 1: Setup & Basics**

#### ✅ Goals:

* Be comfortable using Linux terminal and GCC
* Write, compile, and run C programs

#### 📚 Learn:

* Linux file structure (`/proc`, `/dev`, `/etc`)
* Basics of C (if not solid already)
* Compile C code: `gcc hello.c -o hello`

#### 🛠 Practice:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, Linux syscalls!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

---

### **📂 Step 2: File I/O Syscalls**

#### ✅ Goals:

* Understand `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`

#### 📚 Learn:

* `<fcntl.h>` and `<unistd.h>`
* File descriptors vs file streams

#### 🔧 Key Syscalls:

* `int open(const char *pathname, int flags);`
* `ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);`
* `ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);`
* `int close(int fd);`

#### 🛠 Practice:

* Copy file content (build your own `cp`)
* Count lines in a file

---

### **👶 Step 3: Process Control**

#### ✅ Goals:

* Create and manage processes
* Understand fork-exec-wait model

#### 📚 Learn:

* `fork()`, `exec()`, `wait()`, `exit()`

#### 🔧 Key Syscalls:

* `pid_t fork();`
* `int execvp(const char *file, char *const argv[]);`
* `pid_t wait(int *wstatus);`

#### 🛠 Practice:

* Create a child process that runs `ls`
* Make a program launcher

---

### **🧵 Step 4: Signals**

#### ✅ Goals:

* Understand signals and signal handlers

#### 📚 Learn:

* `kill()`, `signal()`, `sigaction()`

#### 🔧 Key Syscalls:

* `int kill(pid_t pid, int sig);`
* `void (*signal(int signum, void (*handler)(int)))(int);`

#### 🛠 Practice:

* Write a program that catches `SIGINT` (`Ctrl+C`)
* Send signals between processes

---

### **🔒 Step 5: Permissions and Ownership**

#### ✅ Goals:

* Change file permissions and ownership

#### 📚 Learn:

* File modes and `chmod`, `chown` syscalls

#### 🔧 Key Syscalls:

* `int chmod(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);`
* `int chown(const char *pathname, uid_t owner, gid_t group);`

#### 🛠 Practice:

* Write a program to batch-update permissions

---

### **🧠 Step 6: Memory Management**

#### ✅ Goals:

* Use `mmap`, `brk`, `malloc` equivalents

#### 🔧 Key Syscalls:

* `void *mmap(...)`
* `int munmap(...)`

#### 🛠 Practice:

* Memory map a file and read its contents
* Shared memory between processes

---

### **🌐 Step 7: Sockets & Networking (Optional)**

#### ✅ Goals:

* Use low-level sockets to communicate

#### 🔧 Key Syscalls:

* `socket()`, `bind()`, `listen()`, `accept()`, `connect()`

#### 🛠 Practice:

* Build a simple TCP client and server in C

---

### **📊 Step 8: Advanced Topics**

#### ✅ Topics:

* `clone()` vs `fork()` (thread-like behavior)
* `epoll` for scalable IO
* `ptrace` for debugging
* `io_uring` (modern async IO)

---

### 🧪 Practice Projects (combine everything):

* Build your own shell (parse commands, fork+exec, handle signals)
* Recreate a subset of `ls`, `cp`, or `ps`
* Build a syscall tracer (`strace`-like, use `ptrace`)

---

### 📚 Resources

* [Linux man pages](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/)
* Book: **"Linux System Programming" by Robert Love**
* [The Linux Programming Interface (TLPI)](https://man7.org/tlpi/)
